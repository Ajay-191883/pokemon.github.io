        Pokémon, electronic game series from Nintendo that debuted in Japan in
        February 1996 as Pokémon Green and Pokémon Red. The franchise later
        became wildly popular in the United States and around the world. The
        series, originally produced for the company’s Game Boy line of handheld
        consoles, was introduced in 1998 to the United States with two titles,
        known to fans as Red and Blue. In the games, players assume the role of
        Pokémon trainers, obtaining cartoon monsters and developing them to
        battle other Pokémon. Pokémon became one of the most successful video
        game franchises in the world, second only to Nintendo’s Super Mario
        Bros.

          <p>Here is Pikachu</p>
          Pikachu, a yellow mouselike creature, is the undisputed face of
          Pokémon and helped the series become a worldwide phenomenon. Pokémon
          inspired a cartoon series, movies, books, a toy line, sequels,
          spin-offs, a clothing line, and a popular trading-card game. In spite
          of a friendly interface and little violence, Pokémon has not been
          without controversy, however. In 1999 the parents of two nine-year-old
          boys sued Nintendo, stating that the Pokémon card game had caused the
          children to develop gambling problems and likening the trading-card
          craze to an illegal lottery. Religious groups that discount the theory
          of evolution also targeted Pokémon, for showing Pokémon evolving into
          new creatures.

          Beginning in 2006, Pokémon video-game titles were produced exclusively
          for a new handheld console, the Nintendo DS, instead of the Game Boy,
          which was soon discontinued. In 2013 Pokémon X and Pokémon Y debuted
          on the Nintendo 3DS, which employed stereoscopic technology. The
          mobile application Pokémon GO was a blockbuster success upon its
          release in 2016. Developed by Niantic Labs, a former division of
          Google, the game used GPS data and the mobile device’s camera to
          create an “augmented reality” that allowed users to capture Pokémon
          from real-life locations.

          Gotta catch 'em all! When Pokémon arrived on the scene in 1995, it
          totally changed the way nerds played card games forever. Pokémon is an
          awesome game, TV series, and and video game franchise based on
          fictional creatures called "Pokémon" that humans can capture, trade,
          and train to fight for sport. This list features every character from
          the Pokémon video game series. We don't have any of the characters
          from the manga series on here, but we're sure you'll be familiar with
          all the characters if you play the games.

          <br /><br />
          Some Pokémon characters names are a little bit bizarre, but we're
          hoping that this complete list of Pokémon names and pictures will
          clear up any confusion about Pokémon characters with names like
          "Snorlax" and "Mew." This complete list of Pokémon features famous
          characters, like Pikachu, Charizard, and other colorful Pokémon. If
          you're more interested in the best Pokémon, then check out this list
          of the best Legendary and Shiny Pokémon.
